All platforms lack some easy functionality and are overly complicated to people to find each other.

I don't plan to make this a big thing. It should only serve my purpose. I have the following requirements:

- Have a link where people can see what they buy in
  I use this, because most LFG platforms only give you a limit amount of space to write stuff
- People then can bring up interest
- Find dates to play with new people, where no shedule is established
- work good for one-shots

Here are my top 4 complaints:

- Everybody needs an account.
  IMHO it is enough to have one person got an account, and this doesn't even need to be a full fledged account with password and profile.
- Lack of good filtering and searching
- No way to find dates and times

So the idea is to have a platform that works as easy as possible with the most comfort for everyone:

- Only the organizer needs an account
- Everybody else will just find a table and ask for it to join or gets a link to a table
- Table is a synonym of a group that wants to play something together
- Automatic cleanup if you don't want to use it anymore (unless you don't want to get cleaned up automatically. This is opt in)
